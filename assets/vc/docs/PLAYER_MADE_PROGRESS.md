This adds progress points by the amount to the game's statistics. This requires SET_PROGRESS_TOTAL to be initially set in order to have an effect. This affects GET_PROGRESS_PERCENTAGE. The original scripts used only 1 as the integer value but any value works, including negative ones. The value set with this command is saved in block `17` of the save file in GTA III and block `19` in Vice City.

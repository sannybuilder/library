This command activates both the taxi's boost jump and nitrous. Boost jump replaces the horn, which can be activated by pressing button `18` (HORN key). The value set with this opcode is saved in block 0 of the save file. This only works on the player's taxi. It recognizes the following as taxis:

| **Id** | **Name** |
| ------ | -------- |
| 420    | Taxi     |
| 438    | Cabbie   |

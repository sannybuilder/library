This command sets the streaming of additional model s like peds, cars, and maps. The command is primarily used during cutscene setups, most likely to prioritize the explicit loading of models for cutscenes. In Vice City, setting this to `0` will treat the map as if the player has not moved from the spot where the command was called. Traveling further away from the spot will not load the map, showing LOD models and allowing you to fall through the map. Any ped and car models not loaded beforehand will not be loaded, in effect diminishing the variety of peds and cars that spawn naturally in the streets.

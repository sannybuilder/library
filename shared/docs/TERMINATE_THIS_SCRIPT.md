This command stops the execution of the script in which it is used. All data within the script (such as local variables and timers) immediately are nulled and the script is removed from the game memory.

This command must not be used in CLEO scripts. Use CLEO's TERMINATE_THIS_CUSTOM_SCRIPT or TERMINATE_ALL_CUSTOM_SCRIPTS_WITH_THIS_NAME to end the custom script.

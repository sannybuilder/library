This command sets the police to ignore the player. The police becomes unaggressive to the player and does not chase the player; police vehicles spawn with their siren off; they stop their vehicles when close to the player, exit, and walk away, sometimes taking cover and doing nothing; and the police helicopter will not show up. Everything else related to the police remains the same, like attaining wanted level , police deploying spike strips, and spawn rate of the police. Using a garage to respray your vehicle or fit a car bomb resets this effect and resumes the normal behavior of the police.

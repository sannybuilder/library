This command creates a perpetual fire on the vehicle. The fire does not damage the vehicle. It is harmful to the player only when the player stands right beneath the fire. Generally fires on cars are positioned in such a way that it would be hard to get hurt by them, but it is easy to get hurt by fires on bikes and helicopters. Fires can be extinguished with the Firetruck's hose or a Fire Extinguisher, or removed using commands REMOVE_SCRIPT_FIRE or REMOVE_ALL_SCRIPT_FIRES. While the vehicle is on fire, it does not take any damage from environmental fire.

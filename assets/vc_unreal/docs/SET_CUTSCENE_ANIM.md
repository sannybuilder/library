This command sets the cutscene object to the animation in a loaded cutscene. It is required for the model associated with the animation to be loaded. Usually the model has the same name as the animation but it is not always the case; the IFP file contains the relevant data. It is not required to assign the model to the associated animation as long as the model supports the animation it is assigned to.

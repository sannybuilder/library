This conditional command supposedly returns true if there is a sniper bullet within the specified 3d area, but its area detection seems to be bugged. It returns true if a sniper bullet is within any x-coordinate greater than the specified x-coordinate minus the x-radius, any y-coordinate greater than the specified y-coordinate minus the y-radius, and any z-coordinate greater than the specified z-coordinate minus the z-radius. Its cylindrical marker does not reflect the bug and behaves similarly to IS_PLAYER_IN_AREA_3D.

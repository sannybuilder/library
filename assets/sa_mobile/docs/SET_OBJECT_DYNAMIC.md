This command sets the object's ability to be dynamic in the environment. This command only affects dynamic objects and has no effect on static ones. By default, when dynamic objects are created using either CREATE_OBJECT or CREATE_OBJECT_NO_OFFSET, gravity will not affect the object and will float in the air unless acted upon by the environment. Enabling dynamics through this command will allow gravity to affect the object and allow it to drop onto the ground. Disabling dynamics will stop gravity and all environmental effects from affecting the object at that moment; the object can still be affected by the environment and will not be static.

This command gets a random non-mission character in the zone based on its ped type and turns it into a mission character. The flags can add or remove certain categories from the search: civilian (`CIVMALE` and `CIVFEMALE`), gang members (`GANG1`, `GANG2`, `GANG3`, `GANG4`, `GANG5`, `GANG6`, `GANG7`, `GANG8`, and `GANG9`), and criminals and prostitutes (`CRIMINAL` and `PROSTITUTE`).

If the command fails to get anything, it returns `-1`.

This command plays the mission passed audio.

In GTA III the mission passed audio uses `Miscom.wav` file and in Vice City it uses `miscom.mp3` file. The background ambient noise will be disabled and the music will play. In Vice City, music will fade in as it plays and when it finishes background ambient noise will fade back in and resume afterward. In GTA III this happens instantly. Pausing and unpausing the game or playing another audio other than itself will interrupt the audio.

This command draws a corona at a point. It is nearly identical to DRAW_WEAPONSHOP_CORONA and behaves like 2DFX type `0` lights: it is transparent, the corona texture will point towards the player, and "dark" colors means decreased light intensity of the corona. All the corona textures are from the `particle.txd` file. This command must be placed in a loop in order for the corona to appear. Once the corona is placed in a loop, it begins to appear by fading in. When not placed in a loop anymore, it fades out and disappears. Coronas are mainly used as checkpoints in races in the games.

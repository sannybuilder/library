This conditional command returns true when a crane at the coordinates point is lifting the specified vehicle. Somewhat misleadingly, state `3` (moving upwards from pick up) of the crane is ignored; only states `2` (moving to destination) and `4` (moving downwards to drop off) are detected. The coordinates point does not need to be accurate but its distance from the crane must be within `100` units.

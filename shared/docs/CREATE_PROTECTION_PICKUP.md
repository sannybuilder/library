This command creates a type 16 asset revenue pickup. It uses a model that matches the name `bigdollar` . Unlike other pickups, pickups of this type do not disappear when the player character walks over them. Money, which is displayed above the pickup, rises up to the set revenue limit and can be collected by walking through the pickup. The larger the revenue rate value, the faster the money rises. The pickup does not allow collection or display a value if there is less than `$10` revenue. The money pauses from rising if the player character is within 10 units of the pickup. This pickup is generally used for businesses involved in protection rackets.

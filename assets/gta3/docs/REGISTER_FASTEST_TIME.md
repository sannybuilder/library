This command saves the lowest value to almost any stat in the game. The stat can only be overwritten by a value smaller than the previously saved value. Without using other stat-changing commands, in order to change to a higher value, you have to set the value of the stat to `0` and then set the value of the stat to the new value. In Vice City, the original script mainly used these as record times saved in seconds and the stats menu displays them in minutes and seconds. In San Andreas, it can use any integer stats. This command was unused in GTA III's original script. The value set with this command is saved in block `17` of the save file in GTA III and block `19` in Vice City.

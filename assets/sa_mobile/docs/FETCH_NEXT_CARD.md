This command gets the value of the element in an array generated by SHUFFLE_CARD_DECKS, which means a value between `1` and `52` is possible to get. This simulates the fetching of a card from a randomly shuffled deck of 52 cards. Each time the command is called, it iterates through the array. When it reaches the end of the array, it moves onto the next array if it exists. When it finishes all available arrays, it returns back to the first array and repeats the process. If the deck is cleared, it gets the value `0`.

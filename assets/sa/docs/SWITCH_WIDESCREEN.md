This command enables widescreen by placing two black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. It is used mainly for cutscenes to make it look cinematic. When widescreen is enabled, the HUD, radar, crosshairs, scopes are disabled. In Vice City and San Andreas, the game cannot be paused (even minimizing the game won't pause the game when it usually does), text in the middle bottom of the screen is repositioned, text boxes do not appear visually but can be heard appearing, and the screen is squished.

This command displays a counter, either shown in numbers or as a bar. The counter need only be called once and will automatically associate and update itself with the value stored in the global variable. Counters only support global variables storing integer values. For type `1` bar, the length of the empty bar represents values between `0` and `100`. Values outside the range will either underfill or overfill the empty bar. Additional counters cannot be displayed until the existing counter is removed. CLEAR_ONSCREEN_COUNTER removes the counter.

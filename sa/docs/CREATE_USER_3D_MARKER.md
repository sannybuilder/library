This command spawns a 3d marker into the world. The marker is typically used to denote interior access but it does not create access to the actual interior. The number of 3d markers created with this command is limited to five. Unlike most positioning commands, using `-100.0` as the z-coordinate to detect ground z does not work. The 3d marker can be removed using REMOVE_USER_3D_MARKER. It can be seen during replays.

This command will make a helicopter simulate a crash landing. The tail rotor will smoke and spin the helicopter out of control (like in GTA IV). When the helicopter gets close to the ground, it will explode but the helicopter will still be intact and occupants will still be alive. The helicopter can become a flyable wreck. This command has no effect on any other types of vehicles.

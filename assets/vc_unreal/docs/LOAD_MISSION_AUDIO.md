This command loads a wav audio generally played during missions. The audio name is not based on the audio file name; it is based on a predefined list hardcoded into the game, although a vast majority of the names do match the file names. Names are not case sensitive (any upper case letters (A-Z) are converted to lower case by the game internally) and must be 7 characters or less, which is already taken care by the predefined list. HAS_MISSION_AUDIO_LOADED checks if it has been loaded, PLAY_MISSION_AUDIO plays it, and CLEAR_MISSION_AUDIO clears it.

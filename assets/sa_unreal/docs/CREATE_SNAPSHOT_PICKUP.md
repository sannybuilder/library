This creates a photo op pickup. The pickup can only be seen through a camera and it glows at night time without the camera. The only way to "pick" this up is to take a picture of it with a camera. The pickup will disappear after that and it gets recorded in stat 231. The total amount of snapshots taken depends on the amount of pickups you have placed. Taking a photo of one pickup gives you $100. Taking a photo of all the pickups will give you $10000. You can only take a picture of one pickup at a time. If the pickups are too close to each other, it will take the closest one.

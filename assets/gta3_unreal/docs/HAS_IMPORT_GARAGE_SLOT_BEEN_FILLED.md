This conditional command returns true if the import garage contains the needed vehicle model. When the needed model is brought to the garage of a certain type, the garage door opens for it and will close after the player leaves the garage. The player is then rewarded $1,000 and a message with GXT key `GA_13` ("Delivered like a pro. Complete the list and there'll be a bonus for you.") is displayed. When all the needed models are collected, the player is rewarded $200,000 and a message with GXT key `GA_14` ("All the cars. NICE! Here's a little something.") is displayed. If the model brought is not needed, a message with GXT key `GA_19` ("We're not interested in that model.") is displayed and the garage will not open. If the garage already contains the needed model, a message with GXT key `GA_20` ("We got more of these than we can shift. Sorry man, no deal.") is displayed and the garage also will not open.

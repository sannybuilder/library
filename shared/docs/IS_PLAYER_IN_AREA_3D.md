This conditional command returns true if the player is in the cubic area. It allows you to mark the area with a cylindrical marker, colored blue in GTA III and pink in Vice City. The command must be placed in a loop with wait `0` in order for the marker to remain drawn in the world. 

In GTA III only, if debug mode is switched on (DEBUG_ON), a debug cube will also be drawn along with the marker denoting the boundaries of the area.

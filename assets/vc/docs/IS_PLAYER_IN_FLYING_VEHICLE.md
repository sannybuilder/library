This conditional command returns true if the player is in a flying vehicle, either as a driver or a passenger. It behaves the same way as using both commands IS_PLAYER_IN_ANY_HELI and IS_PLAYER_IN_ANY_PLANE together. By default the game will recognize the following list of vehicles as flying vehicles (for which the `IS_HELI` or `IS_PLANE` flag is set in the handling.cfg file):

- Hunter
- Maverick
- Police Maverick
- RC Baron
- RC Goblin
- RC Raider
- Sea Sparrow
- Skimmer
- Sparrow
- VCN Maverick

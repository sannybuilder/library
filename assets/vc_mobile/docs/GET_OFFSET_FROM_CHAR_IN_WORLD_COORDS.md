This command stores a point offset from the character's position. The coordinates it stores are dependent on the direction the character is facing. Unlike GET_CHAR_COORDINATES, if the character is in a vehicle, this command will center on the character's position instead on the vehicle's position. The coordinates the command return will lag behind the character's actual position and is especially noticeable if the character is moving really fast.

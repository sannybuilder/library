This command sets a free hospital visit for the player. When enabled, if the player is wasted, he will not lose any weapons or cash after respawning. The free treatment works once only, so to allow free treatment again, you have to enable it through this command again. This command was never called in the original script of GTA III. The value set with this command is saved in block `16` of the save file in GTA III, block `18` in Vice City, and block `15` in San Andreas.

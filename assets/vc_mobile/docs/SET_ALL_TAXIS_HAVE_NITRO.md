In Vice City, this command activates the taxi's boost jump. Boost jump replaces the horn, which can be activated by pressing button 18 (HORN key). The value set with this command is saved in block `0` of the save file. This only works on the player's taxi. It recognizes the following as taxis:

| **Id** | **Name**    |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 150    | Taxi        |
| 168    | Cabbie      |
| 188    | Zebra Cab   |
| 216    | Kaufman Cab |

This command gets the position of the analogue sticks. Pushing the stick to the maximum positions yields a value of `-128` or `128` depending on the direction, and any position in between yields a value between those two extremes. On a keyboard, the command will always return the extreme values. It is a useful alternative for detecting buttons `0` to `3` (LeftStickX, LeftStickY, RightStickX, RightStickY)

This conditional command returns true depending on the drive type of the car under these circumstances. If the car is front-wheel drive, the command returns true if both the front wheels are off the ground. If the car is rear-wheel drive, the command returns true if both the rear wheels are off the ground. If the car is four-wheel drive, the command returns true if all four wheels are off the ground. Oddly for boats, the command produces an inconsistent return result. It returns true for some boats and false for others. Legacy documentation incorrectly described this command as checking if the car's wheels are on the ground.

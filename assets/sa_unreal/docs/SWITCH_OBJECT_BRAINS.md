This command can be used to temporarily disable AI brains created with ALLOCATE_STREAMED_SCRIPT_TO_OBJECT. It was used in the original game during the mission "Breaking the Bank at Caligula's".

**Overview of Brain Types**

San Andreas has multiple types of AI brains that can be assigned to pedestrians or objects to control their behavior.

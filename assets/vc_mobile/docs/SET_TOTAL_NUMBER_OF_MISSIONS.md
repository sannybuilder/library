In GTA III, this command sets right value of the "Missions passed" stat ( GXT key `FEST_MP`). The left value is affected by REGISTER_MISSION_PASSED and REGISTER_ODDJOB_MISSION_PASSED. The stat initially starts with a value of `0`. That stat does not exist in Vice City so the command has no practical effect there. The value set with this command is saved in block `17` of the save file in GTA III and block `19` in Vice City.

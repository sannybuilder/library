This command sets the total number of hidden packages. If no value is set with this command, the game defaults to <i>3</i> as the total. The value set here will not change the total number of packages displayed in the stats menu but the ratio of collected packages to the ratio of total number of packages will be correct. For example, if there are only five hidden packages and the third is collected, the onscreen display will correctly show "Hidden Package 3 of 5" but the stats menu will show "60 out of 100". The value set with this command is saved in block `16` of the save file in GTA III and block `18` in Vice City.

In GTA3script the parameter for this command should be `0`. The compiler will automatically discover the total number of collectables by counting all occurrences of CREATE_COLLECTABLE1.

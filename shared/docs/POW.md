Please note that the command accepts **fractional** and **negative** values as power argument. Results are calculated in accordance with standard mathematical principles.  
Notable mentions:
* `y = pow {number} x {power} 0.5` performs $y=\sqrt{x}$
* `y = pow {number} x {power} 0.25` performs $y=\sqrt[4]{x}$
* `y = pow {number} x {power} -3.14` performs $y=\frac{1}{x^{3.14}}$

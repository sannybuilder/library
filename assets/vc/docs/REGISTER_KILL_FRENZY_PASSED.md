This command increments by `1` to the left value of the "Rampages passed" stat (GXT key `FEST_RP`). The right value is set using SET_TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_KILL_FRENZIES. The stat will initially start with a value of `0`. The value set with this command is saved in block 17 of the save file. This command was never called in the original script of GTA III; the game already increments the stat without using this command after a rampage is passed.

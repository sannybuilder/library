This command loads a script and launches it as a mission as defined in the beginning of the main script file. If you launch a non-existent mission, the entire script would restart itself during gameplay and could crash the game. The total number of the missions is limited for each game as the following: `120` missions in total in GTA III and Vice City, and `200` ones in SA. These scripts are normally structured as missions but it is not required and can be treated as non-mission scripts, though they still need to be defined as a mission. Changes made within these scripts do not require starting a new game. LAUNCH_MISSION for GTA III and Vice City behaves similarly to this command except scripts are not defined as a mission.

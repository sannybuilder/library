This conditional command returns true if the player is wasted or busted when on a mission. The command only has an effect when placed in scripts launched using LOAD_AND_LAUNCH_MISSION_INTERNAL or, in GTA III and Vice City only, LAUNCH_MISSION; it has no effect elsewhere. Using SET_DEATHARREST_STATE can disable this check for the current script. In GTA III, this command also returns true if any vehicle added to the upside down cars array is stuck on its roof &mdash; this feature is unused in the original script of GTA III.

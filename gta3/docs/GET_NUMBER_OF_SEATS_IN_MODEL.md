This command stores the number of seats in the model. The model should be a valid vehicle model as defined in the CARS section of the IDE file, otherwise the command returns a useless result. Some returned values are hardcoded as described below:

| Model Id | Model Name | Number of seats |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| 97       | FIRETRUK   | 2               |
| 124      | TRAIN      | 3               |
| 127      | COACH      | 2 or 9          |
| 131      | RCBANDIT   | 1               |

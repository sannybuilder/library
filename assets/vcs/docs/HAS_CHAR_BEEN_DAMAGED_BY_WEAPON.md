This conditional command returns true if the character has been damaged by the specified weapon or environment. The last damage done to the character can be cleared using CLEAR_CHAR_LAST_WEAPON_DAMAGE. Values outside the range of weapon types are supported for a variety of environmental damage. Weapon types for projectiles do not get recognized so environmental damage types have to be used instead.

This command allows the object model closest to the center of the search area to become invisible. It affects objects placed through the IPL, placed through the script using CREATE_OBJECT and others, and even swapped through the script using SWAP_NEAREST_BUILDING_MODEL. Don't forget its LOD model if it has one. The collision model of the object is not affected by this and will remain solid if the object is invisible. If you are unable to make an invisible object visible again, make that object invisible then back to visible. It is not recommended to use this on dynamic objects that can respawn like streetlights.

The object's invisibility setting is saved in block `0` of the save file in GTA III, block `0` in Vice City, and block `1` in San Andreas, as long as the object model is set to invisible; if the object model is visible, the game no longer save that information. The game can save a maximum of `20` object models.

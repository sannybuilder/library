This command saves the highest value to the "Longest time in bloodring" stat (GXT key `ST_LTBR`). The stat will initially start with a value of `0` but it will not be displayed in the stats menu until the value is greater than `0`. Any value higher than the saved value will update the saved value with the new value; lower values have no effect on the stat. The value set with this command is saved in block `19` of the save file .

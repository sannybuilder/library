This command loads a special character into the specified memory slot. It is required when using CREATE_CHAR with special models or SET_CUTSCENE_ANIM during cutscenes. An interesting thing about this command is that the DFF model does not need to be defined in an IDE file. All it needs is a functional character model. HAS_SPECIAL_CHARACTER_LOADED checks if the character has been loaded and UNLOAD_SPECIAL_CHARACTER unloads it.

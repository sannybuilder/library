This command spawns a random car at the coordinates point. The car acts like a parked car once it is spawned, so if you leave the car alone it would disappear, and jacking it near the police will make you wanted. The command needs to be called again if you want to spawn another random car. Unfortunately, you cannot assign any flags to this car with this command. This command is mainly used in large carparks or parking lots. The cars it will spawn tends to be the ones already spawned on the streets.

This command sets the time scale of the game, affecting most time-dependent actions within the game though not all of them. Negative values will have odd effects and can cause gameplay to be unplayable, while values greater than `4.0` do not have noticeable speed increases. Certain hardcoded events can override your set time scale, including cheats that control the time scale like `onspeed` and `booooooring` in Vice City, adrenaline effects, and snapping photos with the camera.

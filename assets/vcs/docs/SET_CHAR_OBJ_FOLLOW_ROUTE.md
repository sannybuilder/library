This command sets the character's objective to walk along a route created by ADD_ROUTE_POINT. If the path is obstructed, the character cannot complete the route. When used on the player character, the player character becomes uncontrollable as it follows the route. Entering a vehicle, getting wasted, or getting busted regains control of the player character. Assigning certain objectives or clearing it using SET_CHAR_OBJ_NO_OBJ will stop any character from following the route.

This command sets the police to ignore the player. The police becomes unaggressive to the player and does not chase the player; police vehicles spawn with their siren off; they stop their vehicles when close to the player, exit, and walk away, sometimes taking cover and doing nothing; and the police helicopter will not show up. Everything else related to the police remains the same, like attaining wanted level, police deploying spike strips, and spawn rate of the police. Using a garage to respray your vehicle or fit a car bomb resets this effect and resumes the normal behavior of the police.

This command adds to the character's weapon ammo and sets the weapon as the current one for the character. If the character does not have the weapon, the weapon is given to it and replaces any weapon of the same slot. Using this command requires loading the weapon model through 0247 or else the weapon might not be visible which can crash the game. When the character dies, it drops the weapon as a pickup type `PICKUP_ONCE_TIMEOUT` with predefined ammo count.

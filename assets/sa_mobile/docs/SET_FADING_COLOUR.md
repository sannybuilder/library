This command sets the RGB color of a fade. When the game is fading either in or out using DO_FADE, the fade overlay screen will be set to the color. Colors can be actively set during fading. This color is reset during certain hardcoded fade events listed below that set their own fade color. Using the unique set of values "0 0 0" in GTA III or "2 2 2" in Vice City and San Andreas allows the game to fade into the last loaded splash screen, which is loaded through LOAD_SPLASH_SCREEN, instead of a color.

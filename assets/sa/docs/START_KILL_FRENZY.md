This command starts a rampage. A countdown timer and target kill counter appear on the right side of the HUD. The player is given the specified weapon with 30000 ammo, weapon scrolling is disabled, and the ability to collect any pickups is disabled. The model of the weapon must be loaded beforehand in order for the weapon to appear correctly. The targets must be killed with the specified weapon in order to register the kill with the exception of vehicles, which are counted when they explode from anything. When the timer reaches ten seconds, beeps are sounded until the rampage ends. When the timer reaches three seconds, the timer flashes. Passing the rampage removes any wanted level. The name "kill frenzy" comes from GTA 2 where rampages are called kill frenzies.

In Vice City, calling the command disables the taxi shortcut drop-off set by SET_SHORTCUT_DROPOFF_POINT_FOR_MISSION.

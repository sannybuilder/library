This command gets the data of two wheels, wheelie, and stoppie stunts. After the command is called, all the stunt data are immediately set `0`. The two wheels or stoppie stunt must be performed for more than two seconds or the wheelie stunt for more than 5 seconds in order to be able to get any data for those stunts &mdash; the three stunts are independent of each other but the duration and distance of each stunt are dependent on the stunt. Interestingly the game does not use this command to register stunt data into the statistics; it registers them regardless of this command. This command is primarily used to display stunt data onscreen in the stunt jump script in the original script.

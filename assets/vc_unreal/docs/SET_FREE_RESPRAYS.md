This command sets all spray shops to free. You can have your vehicle sprayed even with no money, and no money will be deducted after using it. The value set with this command is saved in block `2` of the save file in GTA III, block `2` in Vice City, and block `3` in San Andreas.

The effect of this command carries over into a new game &mdash; if spray shops are set to free during gameplay, starting a new game will have all spray shops already set to free. This bug is fixed in the SilentPatch.

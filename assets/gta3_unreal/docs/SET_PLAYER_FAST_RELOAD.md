This command sets the player's ability to reload certain weapon s quickly. Only some weapons take full advantage of this ability by skipping the reload sequence completely. They include the Python, sniper rifles, and Rocket Launcher. Other weapons partially take advantage of this by replacing the reload animation with a short pause. They include pistols, sub-machine guns, and rifles. Shotguns do not take advantage of this; they merely silence the reload sound effect. The value set with this command is saved in block `16` of the save file in GTA III, block `18` in Vice City, and block `15` in San Andreas. This command was never called in the original script of GTA III.

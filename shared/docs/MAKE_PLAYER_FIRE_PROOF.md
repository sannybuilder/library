This command allows the player to be fire proof. Similar to SET_CHAR_PROOFS's fire proof property, fire does not reduce the health of the player. Unlike SET_CHAR_PROOFS, the player can still be set on fire and react to the fire, and the command's setting can be loaded from a saved game. The value set with this command is saved in block `18` of the save file in Vice City and block `15` in San Andreas.

This command terminates the active mission by executing its mission cleanup routine. It only affects active missions with a specific structure and has no effect elsewhere. This command should not be called during cutscenes because it can skip over CLEAR_CUTSCENE, preventing you from resuming control of your character, unless the command is placed in the mission cleanup routine. Names used in alternative documentations include abort_mission and terminate_active_mission.

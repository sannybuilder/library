This command loads cutscene data from the associated IFP and DAT files, in addition to the CUT file in San Andreas, in the `anim\cuts.img` archive file. In GTA III and Vice City, the player is made safe with MAKE_PLAYER_SAFE_FOR_CUTSCENE and many environmental noise is disabled or muffled. The behavior can be ended using CLEAR_CUTSCENE. The cutscene can be started using START_CUTSCENE.

This command allows the character to pull out and listen into the mobile phone. The phone model (specifically model index `258`) has to be loaded in order for the phone to appear. The command is intended to be used while on foot and unarmed. It is buggy when used while driving, similar in effect to when the player changes clothes while on a bike, and the animation looks awkward when armed with certain weapons. When on the phone, many controls become restricted like the inability to sprint, jump, crouch, or enter cars.

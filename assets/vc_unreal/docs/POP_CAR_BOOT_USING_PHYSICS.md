This command opens the trunk lid or tailgate of a vehicle if it has one. The force is strong enough to make the lid bounce up and down a few times. Unlike POP_CAR_BOOT, which visually behaves in a similar way, the lid is affected by physics when popped open and does not crash the game if the vehicle does not have a trunk. If the lid is already opened, it will still bounce up and down.

This creates a fire on the character. The fire damages the character like any fire and can harm the player. The character is set to flee but it can be interrupted by assigning it an objective. The fire can be extinguished with the Firetruck's hose or a Fire Extinguisher, or removed using commands REMOVE_SCRIPT_FIRE or REMOVE_ALL_SCRIPT_FIRES. To prevent the character from burning to death but still have it on fire like in the Firefighter mission, the player must be in a vehicle and the character set to only be damaged by player trough SET_CHAR_ONLY_DAMAGED_BY_PLAYER. Exiting the vehicle will make the fire start hurting the character; getting back into the vehicle will stop hurting it. The fire will oddly randomly put itself out if the character is interrupted.

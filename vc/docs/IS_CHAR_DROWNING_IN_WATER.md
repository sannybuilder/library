This conditional command returns true when the character is taking damage from ocean water while on foot. It returns false otherwise, including when the character is drowning while in a vehicle. This command is not supported in the original PS2 version. It first appeared in the PC version as a replacement for IS_CHAR_IN_WATER in the "CELL" script (cellphone calls are ended when you are drowning, not when you are merely touching water).

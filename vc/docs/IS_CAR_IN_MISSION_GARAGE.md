This conditional command returns true if a vehicle has been dropped off in the garage. The command name is misleading; it does not simply check if a vehicle is in the garage. A vehicle is considered dropped off if the garage is of type `1`, `14`, or `21`; has targeted the vehicle ; the vehicle is in the garage; and the garage door has closed itself. Affecting the state of the garage afterwards (e.g. opening the garage ) causes the garage to forget the drop off.

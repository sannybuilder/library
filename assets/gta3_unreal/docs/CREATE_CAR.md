This command creates a vehicle at the coordinates point. Using this command requires the model to be already loaded, usually through REQUEST_MODEL, or else the game might crash. The major script editors like Sanny Builder support using the vehicle's DFF model name and automatically converts those values into integers upon compilation. The Enforcer, Police, and Rhino are locked initially (lock state 5) when spawned; they can be unlocked using LOCK_CAR_DOORS or if any driver exits the vehicle. All vehicles created by this command outside a mission will become near-permanent in the game until MARK_CAR_AS_NO_LONGER_NEEDED is used to mark it as no longer needed.

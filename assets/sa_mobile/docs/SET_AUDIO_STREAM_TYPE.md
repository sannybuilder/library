CLEO5 introduced concept of stream types:
* **None** - no automatic volume or speed corrections are applied (like in CLEO4)
* **Sfx** - automatically corrected by global SFX volume settings and in-game speed changes
* **Music** - automatically corrected by global music volume settings, muted if current in-game speed is not 1.0
* **UserInterface** - automatically corrected by global SFX volume settings, unaffected by in-game speed

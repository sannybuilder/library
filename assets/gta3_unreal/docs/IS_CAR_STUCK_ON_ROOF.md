This conditional command returns true if the vehicle is "stuck on its roof," i.e. the vehicle has been added to the upside down car check and its translational and rotational movements are minimal while upside down for more than a certain threshold. The threshold is `1` second in GTA III and Vice City, and `2` seconds in San Andreas. This command remains in effect if the vehicle is exploded. Note that in GTA III, if there is a vehicle in the upside down cars array that is stuck on its roof during missions with death/arrest state switched on, the game will execute a death/arrest and fail the mission regardless of this command.

This command saves the highest value to the "Best INSANE stunt so far" stat (GXT key `BSTSTU`). The stat will initially start with a value of `0`. Any value higher than the saved value will update the saved value with the new value; lower values have no effect on the stat. The value set with this command is saved in block 17 of the save file in GTA III and block 19 in Vice City. The stats menu displays the values as follows:

| Value | GXT key | Display                        |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0     | NOSTUC  | No INSANE stunts completed     |
| 1     | INSTUN  | Insane stunt                   |
| 2     | PRINST  | Perfect insane stunt           |
| 3     | DBINST  | Double insane stunt            |
| 4     | DBPINS  | Perfect double insane stunt    |
| 5     | TRINST  | Triple insane stunt            |
| 6     | PRTRST  | Perfect triple insane stunt    |
| 7     | QUINST  | Quadruple insane stunt         |
| 8     | PQUINS  | Perfect quadruple insane stunt |

Any value outside this range displays as "No INSANE stunts completed".

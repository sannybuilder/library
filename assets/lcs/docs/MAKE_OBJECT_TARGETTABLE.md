This command makes the object targetable (ability to be auto-aimed). Auto-aim only has an effect when using classic or joypad controls; it has no use in standard controls. In GTA III and Vice City, there is no way to remove this property from the object without deleting and recreating the object. There can only be four targetable objects at a time. Trying to make more objects targetable yields no effect. This property of the object is saved in block `1` of the save file in GTA III and block `1` in Vice City.

This command influences the name associated with a game save as seen in the game save menu. If the command is called, the name of the game save is only updated after the player saves the game. The data is saved in blocks `0` and `17` of the save file in GTA III, blocks `0` and `19` in Vice City, and blocks `0` and `16` in San Andreas. If the command has never been called, saving the game defaults the text to the GXT key `ITBEG` (usually named "In the beginning..."). Any text formatting using tilde (~) will not appear in the name of the save file. Text that is too long (more than `22` characters including spaces, punctuations, etc.) will truncate at `18` characters and be ended with ellipses. Invalid GXT strings will remove the name of the save file and defaults to "Save File x Not Present" for the name. In GTA III, this command increments by `1` to the left value of the "Missions passed" stat ( GXT key `FEST_MP`). The right value is affected by SET_TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_MISSIONS. In Vice City, calling the command disables the taxi shortcut drop-off set by SET_SHORTCUT_DROPOFF_POINT_FOR_MISSION.

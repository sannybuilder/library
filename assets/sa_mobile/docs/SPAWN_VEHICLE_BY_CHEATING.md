This command spawns a vehicle in front of the player without requiring the model to be preloaded. Despite its name, using this command does not affect cheat statistics.

Unlike CREATE_CAR, vehicles created with this command are not flagged as owned by the player (`VEHICLEFLAG_HASBEENOWNEDBYPLAYER`). 
As a result, entering such a vehicle for the first time grants a small number of chaos points, which in some cases may be enough to trigger a wanted level.

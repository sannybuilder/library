This command saves the highest value to the "Max. INSANE Jump dist." stat (GXT key `MXCARDM` and `MXCARD` for GTA III, only `MXCARDM` for Vice City). The stat will initially start with a value of `0.0`. Any value higher than the saved value will update the saved value with the new value; lower values have no effect on the stat. The value set with this command is saved in block 17 of the save file in GTA III and block 19 in Vice City. Although the stats menu displays the value with two decimal places, the stats menu will always round the value down to the nearest whole number.

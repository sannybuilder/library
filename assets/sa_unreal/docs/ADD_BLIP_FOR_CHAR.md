This command adds a square blip in the radar denoting the location of the character and a red arrow (marker) above the character. It is almost equivalent to ADD_BLIP_FOR_CHAR_OLD but the properties of the blip are preset. The default properties of the blip, which can be changed using other commands, are:

- Color: 7 (red)
- Scale: 3
- Display: 3 (both blip and marker)

Both the blip and marker can be removed using REMOVE_BLIP.
